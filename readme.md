This project was written in C++ and contains several dependancies for graphical rendering and vector maths library.
Please follow the install and build instructions to get it running on your machine.

The code repository is on my Github
	-URL: https://github.com/MathDotSqrt/Covid
	-CLONE: https://github.com/MathDotSqrt/Covid.git


To download repository, I recommend using the git clone command. But you can use your browser to view the code via the url.

git clone https://github.com/MathDotSqrt/Covid.git

It will download and install the repository in the folder it ran in.

The source files and librarys should all be there, but if you want to build it you will have to open
the .sln file with visual studio. 

When the solution is opened you should see a project called 'Covid'. Open it and open 'Source Files'. Then open main.cpp.

To build all you need to do is click the green arrow on top. Make sure it is in release mode or else the code will run incredibly slow. 

I have provided commented out code to run different scenarios of the model.




IMPORTANT FILES:
common.h: defines all the parameters of the model
main.cpp: launches the model
plot.h:   defines what version of the model to run visually


--If you do not have visual studios please email me at ctrenkov@gmu.edu so we can work out a way to build the model on your machine. 

Let me know if there are other issues.
